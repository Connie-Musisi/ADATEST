  n.taxa0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{phyloseq} object containing filtered microbiome data.}

\item{group_var}{Character. The name of the grouping variable in the sample metadata. Passed from \code{ADATEST()}.}

\item{group_levels}{Character vector of length two. The two levels of \code{group_var} to be compared. Passed from \code{ADATEST()}.}

\item{t0}{Numeric. Lower threshold for classifying non-differential pseudo-taxa. Passed from \code{ADATEST()}.}

\item{t1}{Numeric. Threshold for identifying moderate differential abundance. Passed from \code{ADATEST()}.}

\item{t2}{Numeric. Upper bound for classifying pseudo-taxa. Passed from \code{ADATEST()}.}

\item{empirical_adjust}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, downsamples group 2 using an empirical distribution. Passed from \code{ADATEST()}.}

\item{n.taxa0}{Optional. Number of non-DA pseudo-taxa to retain. Passed from \code{ADATEST()}.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{pseudo_lfc}{Vector of log fold changes for pseudo-taxa.}
\item{Train}{A \code{phyloseq} object containing the training dataset with pseudo-taxa labeled as \code{I_0} or \code{I_1}.}
}
}
\description{
Constructs a pseudo-dataset from microbiome data to support adaptive differential abundance (DA) testing.
This internal function is called by \code{ADATEST()} to generate synthetic pseudo-taxa for model training,
based on taxon pairing, log fold change (LFC) classification, and optional empirical adjustment.
}
\details{
This function is not intended to be called directly by users. It is part of the internal ADATEST pipeline:
\enumerate{
\item Taxa are paired within the reference group to generate pseudo-taxa.
\item Pseudo-taxa are filtered for prevalence and abundance.
\item LFCs are computed and centered; taxa are classified into \code{I_0}, \code{I_1}, or \code{I_B}.
\item The training set includes only pseudo-taxa from \code{I_0} and \code{I_1}.
\item If needed, empirical resampling balances group sizes before model training.
