\title{Compute Test Statistic for Differential Abundance Analysis}
\usage{
Test_Statistic(org_otu, Train_parest, n1, n2, B)
}
\arguments{
\item{org_otu}{A numeric matrix representing the scaled OTU table from the original dataset, with samples in rows and taxa in columns.}

\item{Train_parest}{A numeric vector of trained regression parameters (scores) obtained from \code{Train_analyze()}.}

\item{n1}{Integer. Number of samples in group 1. Passed from \code{Orig_Alz_Perm()}.}

\item{n2}{Integer. Number of samples in group 2. Passed from \code{Orig_Alz_Perm()}.}

\item{B}{Integer. Number of permutations (included for interface consistency; not used directly in this function).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of test statistics, one for each taxon.
}
\description{
Computes a test statistic for each taxon based on the trained regression parameters (scores) from the PLS model.
Samples are grouped, sorted by abundance, and aligned based on group-level means to reduce noise and enhance interpretability.
This function is used internally by \code{Orig_Alz_Perm()}.
}
\details{
For each taxon:
\itemize{
\item The function compares group-specific mean abundances to determine ordering.
\item OTUs are sorted within each group to reduce intra-group variability.
\item Taxa are then aligned by group and multiplied by the regression scores to yield a final test statistic.
}
The output is used to assess significance against permuted null distributions in the overall ADATEST pipeline.
