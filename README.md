# ADATEST: An Adaptive Test for Differential Abundance in Microbiome Studies
## Overview
The ADATEST package implements a novel adaptive test for differential abundance analysis (DAA) in microbiome studies when there are two groups. This method is designed to handle the complex characteristics of microbiome data, such as sparsity, compositionality, and overdispersion. It utilizes order statistics and considers DA as a prediction problem, leveraging the high dimensionality of the data.

## Installation
To install the latest version of ADATEST from GitHub, you can use the 'devtools' package.
```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("Connie-Musisi/ADATEST")
```
## Code
See example vignette for more explanation on how to use ADATEST on a real dataset.
